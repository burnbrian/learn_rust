# learn_rust
## Introduction
Small projects and challenges to learn the Rust programming language. Inspired by [h0mbre's Learning-C](https://github.com/h0mbre/Learning-C/tree/master) repository. My solutions may be found in the `**/src` sub-folder of each assignment -- try to solve them yourself without looking. Disclaimer: you're learning with me, proceed at your own ~~rust~~ risk.
