# Instructions
Prompt a user to input a radius. Calculate a circle's area given the user's radius with $`A = \pi r^2`$. Print the area to standard output.

# Bonus Points
1. Use `expect` to handle errors if user does not provide input
2. Use `expect` to handle errors if the user provides something strange like an emoji
3. Define PI as a constant before using it to perform the calculation

# Hints
1. You'll need to cast the radius variable and remove newlines `\n`
2. Shadow the user input to a number `f64`

# Example Output
