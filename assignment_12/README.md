# Instructions
Use `impl`, `struct`, and `iter` to print the areas of rectangles with the following characteristics:

1. Width: `50`, Height: `60`
2. Width: `51`, Height: `61`
3. Width: `52`, Height: `62`
4. Width: `53`, Height: `63`
5. Width: `54`, Height: `64`
6. Width: `55`, Height: `65`

# Hints
1. Use `#[derive(Debug)]`,`{:?}`, and `dbg!(&rectangle)` to debug your `struct`
