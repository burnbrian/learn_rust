# Instructions
Prompt the user for a number. Determine if the number is prime and return the primality to standard output.

# Bonus Points
1. Check multiple numbers until user quits the program
2. Create a separate function outside of main to check primality
3. Find out what the largest number you can store is, e.g. u32, u128
