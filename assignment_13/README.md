# Instructions
Use the Fibonacci reccurrence relation to calculate the **nth** Fibonacci number. The next number in the Fibonacci sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. Example shown below:

```text
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)
```

Try using both `if` statements and `match` to create your Fibonacci function.
